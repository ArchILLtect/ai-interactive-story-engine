## Overview
**MOXIE** is the primary pacing, risk, and tension mechanic of the game.

It represents the character’s:
- Momentum
- Luck
- Grit
- Narrative leverage

MOXIE is a **first-class system**, not a cosmetic stat.

---

## Core Rules

- MOXIE has a current value and a max value
- MOXIE is consumed when taking actions
- MOXIE influences outcome probabilities
- When MOXIE reaches 0, the Act (or Run) ends

## MOXIE Bands

| MOXIE Range | Narrative State        | Outcome Bias |
|------------|------------------------|--------------|
| High       | Confident / Dominant   | Success ↑    |
| Medium     | Strained / Risky       | Mixed        |
| Low        | Desperate / Fragile    | Failure ↑    |
| 0          | Exhausted              | Act End     |

The exact numeric ranges are configurable per Act.

## MOXIE Cost per Choice

Each choice defines:
- Base MOXIE cost
- Risk multiplier
- Possible MOXIE refund

Example:
- Safe action: low cost, low reward
- Bold action: higher cost, higher upside

---

## MOXIE Refunds

MOXIE may be partially refunded when:
- A high-risk choice succeeds
- A clever or thematic decision is made
- Special traits or items apply

Refunds reinforce player agency and smart play.
